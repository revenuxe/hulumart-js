This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Before starting the development server, copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
in the project root (next to `package.json`). In PowerShell:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env.local
```

Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in
`.env.local` to your Supabase project's URL and public anon key. The template
includes a project URL but leaves the key empty. Next.js does not load
`.env.example`, and the catalog requires both values to connect to Supabase.
Keep `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` server-only; do not use it as the public key.
The remaining variables in the template configure admin access and image storage.

Restart the development server after changing `.env.local`. For deployments,
configure the environment variables in your hosting environment before building.

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
