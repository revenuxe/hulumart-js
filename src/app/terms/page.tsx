          These Terms &amp; Conditions (&quot;Terms&quot;) govern your access to and use
          of the {SITE_NAME} website, mobile experience, and event decoration services
          (together, the &quot;Service&quot;), operated by {SITE_NAME} (&quot;{SITE_NAME}

        <p>
          By booking a decoration service, creating an account, or otherwise using the
          Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, please
          do not use the Service.

      <p>
        {SITE_NAME} offers event and balloon decoration services: you choose a
        setup from our catalogue (or request a custom theme), we confirm your event
        date, time window, and venue address, and our decorators design, deliver,
        and install the setup on-site ahead of your event — with teardown handled
        after, where included in your package. Setup windows shown at booking are
        estimates and not a guaranteed arrival time.

        You must be at least 18 years old, or using the Service under the
        supervision of a parent or guardian, to create an account and place an
        order. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your
        account credentials and for all activity that occurs under your account.

        <p>
          When you book a decoration, you confirm that the venue address, event
          date, and time window you provide are accurate, and that our decorators
          will have reasonable access to the venue (parking/loading access, and
          entry at the agreed setup time) to complete installation before your
          event. {SITE_NAME} is not responsible for delays caused by restricted
          venue access, incorrect address details, or venue-side scheduling
          conflicts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Setups are designed and installed to the theme, colours, and add-ons
          selected at the time of booking. Please review your selections carefully
          before confirming — changes requested after a decorator has already
          sourced materials for your event may incur an additional charge or may
          not be accommodated depending on how close the change is to your event
          date.

        All prices are displayed in Indian Rupees (INR) and are inclusive of
        applicable taxes unless stated otherwise. Payment is collected through our
        secure third-party payment processor; {SITE_NAME} does not store your full
        card or payment credentials. Prices may change from time to time, but the
        price shown to you at the time of order confirmation is the price you pay
        for that order.

          You may cancel a booking free of charge while it is still
          &quot;Pending&quot; — that is, before we&apos;ve confirmed it and our
          decorators have begun sourcing materials for your event. Once a booking
          is confirmed, it can no longer be self-cancelled from your account;
          contact us directly and we&apos;ll do our best to accommodate a change or
          cancellation depending on how close it is to your event date.
        </p>
        <p>
          If our team is unable to deliver a confirmed setup, or a genuine setup
          defect is identified on-site, contact us on the day of your event and we
          will re-work the setup on the spot where possible, or refund the affected
          booking at our discretion.

      <p>
        We offer reasonable on-site adjustments to a setup at installation time
        (positioning, minor styling tweaks) where it doesn&apos;t require sourcing
        new materials. Larger changes requested on the day — a different theme,
        colours, or scale of decoration than what was booked — may be chargeable
        or may not be accommodated depending on material availability.

      <p>
        We install at the venue address on file for your booking. Please ensure
        someone is available to grant our decorators access at the agreed setup
        time. Risk of loss or damage to the decor passes to you once installation
        is complete. Setup and teardown timelines may be affected by venue access,
        traffic, weather, or circumstances beyond our reasonable control.
